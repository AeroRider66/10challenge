# Challenge 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

This application is designed to allow a user to create an '.svg' file that is built with the input from the user.  The '.svg' file will be saved, and can be used directly or copied as desired. This app may be used by all levels of programmers and will allow users to quickly generate an image for their use, based on criteria they supply. There is no limit on usage, and the image produced can be used for any purpose.

## Installation

Prior to use of this program, the user must have installed node.js and npm inquirer and Jest.  Additionally, the user must have read/write access to the directory level (called 'Develop' in this app) and to the 'result' folder within the Develop folder.  The  User will be required to use a terminal window and must be able to operate in a CLI environment.

## Usage

Once in the CLI environment, the user must navigate the folder containing the 'index.js' file.  Install npm (if not present already), and then in the command line type, 'node index.js'.  The program will execute and the user will be presented with a series of 5 questions regarding the text (3 letters), text color, desired shape, text size, and shape color.  Completion of these questions will result in a file called 'logo.svg' being created in the 'examples' directory located in the root directory.  
There are library files in (in the 'lib' directory) that contain the shape rendering functions of the shape polygon points (currently square, circle, and triangle).  The index.js file is used to capture the user's answers from the CLI, and based on those answers, it will choose the correct pattern, render the shape into a file for use.
